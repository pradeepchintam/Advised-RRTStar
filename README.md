##################################### Simulation Results #################################


Please watch the .webm files. BIT*, RRT*, Informed RRT* and Advised-RRT* simulation results are recorded. The results are very similar to Table IV in our paper. The results are not exact due to the random nature of the sampling based algorithms.
